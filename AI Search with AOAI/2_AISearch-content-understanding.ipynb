    "# AI Search with Azure Content Understanding\n",
    "This document illustrates an example workflow for how to leverage the Azure AI Content Understanding API to enhance the quality of document search.\n",
    "> ✨ ***Note*** <br>\n",
    "The sample will demonstrate the following steps:\n",
    "1. Extract the layout and content of a document using Azure AI Document Intelligence.\n",
    "2. For each figure in the document, extract its content with a custom analyzer using Azure AI Content Understanding, and insert it into the corresponding location in the document content.\n",
    "3. Chunk and embed the document content with LangChain and Azure OpenAI, and index them with Azure Search to generate an Azure Search index.\n",
    "4. Utilize an OpenAI chat model to search through content in the document with a natural language query.\n",
